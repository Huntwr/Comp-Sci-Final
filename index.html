They revolutionized the way that we store and analyze data. A common way that computers store data is by using plain text files, they are small and easy to organize. You can also organize the data into CSV, comma-separated values. This helps organize the data and is useful for breaking down what the data is and analyzing it. Databases are the most common way to store data, they hold data in different files and formats and allow users to analyze or extract the specific data they need without taking excess data. Databases are the best way of storing for the amount of storage and the tools that come with it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Big Data</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the age of computers comes an extreme amount of data. Every time anyone uses a piece of technology they are creating an extreme amount of data. Things such as a single MRI scan is 20,000 photos. Current ways of storing these big data sets are just not working anymore and it is now a challenge for computer scientists. But luckily because of all this data, we are now able to analyze things more precisely and make accurate assessments of the data. But currently, there is still the problem of storage, how can we store Zetabytes of data? We have things such as data centers where all they do is store data but it&#39;s expensive to run and not easy to keep running. Big data is extremely helpful to understanding the world around us and how people use the internet but is also extremely difficult to store due to the massive size and amount of data. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Bias in Machine Learning</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning is an extremely important and extremely popular subject in the computer science space right now, it is a way of using algorithms to make a computer &ldquo;think&rdquo; for itself. Of course, it&#39;s not thinking for itself it is simply following a set of rules to get a specific outcome. Computer scientists can feed computers inputs and expected outputs to train the algorithms, Although because of human bias with the information being fed to the computers it can create bias for the computer. In 2016 an algorithm was being tested that would judge how likely criminals were to reoffend. This algorithm overestimated the reoffending rate of black defendants and underestimated the white defendants. The algorithm was not trained to know the race of the defendants yet it was able to sort based on race. Algorithms are trained purely off of what humans feed them therefore human bias easily sneaks its way into the output of the algorithm. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Unit Test</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit test taught me how each of the big ideas is put into practice, It gave me example problems of how to read understand, and optimize the data that I was looking at. I now know how to read data and what the data is telling me, furthermore, I can understand how that data relates to a real-world problem and how I might see it in the future. I also learned how I can optimize machine learning algorithms to better the results that I am getting. There were a couple of word problems on that subject asking what someone could do to make the results more specific and it sharpened my understanding of the matter. Overall the unit exam put a lot of the subjects that I have been learning about into practice and furthered my understanding of the subjects. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Data used</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I used the Netflix show database from </span><span class="c8"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1714971217072259&amp;usg=AOvVaw14dKoYLqgsmrFi0_WVVkf2">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Question</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am going to use the data to determine if the length of a movie on Netflix has any correlation with the rating it received (G,PG,PG-13,R) </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Introduction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I will be using a database that has records of movies and TV shows on Netflix as of mid-2021, I will be investigating if the length of movies on Netflix has any correlation to the movie&#39;s MPA Rating system (Motion Picture Association Film Rating System). For the purposes of this research I will be referring to the movie&#39;s MPA Rating just as its rating, note this has nothing to do with the quality of the movie but the material&#39;s suitability for different age groups. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Analysis </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 309.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 309.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span>I started by looking for what rating was the most common, From the data we can see that R is the most common movie rating on Netflix by a lot. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then I graphed how common the length of the movies is, this chart looks very similar to the previous chart with 94 minutes long being the most common movie length</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I then wanted to look at if there was a correlation </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 236.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 236.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this chart I filtered the data for all the R-rated movies and made a chart to show how common the lengths of the movies were, my prediction was correct showing that 94 minutes while the most common for all of the movie ratings is also the most common for R rated movies </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 241.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 241.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This chart is to test the main question, this shows that although generally the higher the rating the longer the movie it is not big enough of a difference to truely make a solid conclusion on this question. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Conclusion </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In conclusion, the length of the film has nothing to do with its rating. Through my research, I discovered that R-rated movies are the most common on Netflix with most of the R rated movies being 94 or 97 minutes long. But after looking at the average length of each of the ratings it can be seen that the higher the rating the longer the movie but this is not completely accurate. PG-13 has on average the longest movies but PG-13 is not the highest rating a movie can receive NR (Non-Rated) which can have any type of content and could be higher than R in some situations only has an average run time of 94 minutes. Overall while generally the lower-rated movies are shorter the higher-rated movies can be short or long and it has nothing to do with the rating. </span></p></body></html>
